Lab5:
    9/17: pushed Tools.C & Tools.h
    9/17: Edited and pushed makefile
    9/17: In RegisterFile.C: wrote and completed constructor
        and getInstance().
    9/19: Dustin and I equal amount of effort into the remainder
        of this file, with me writing and pushing the code.
    9/19: ConditionCodes.C: I wrote the code and pushed the code,
        Dustin and I put equal amount of effort on all the methods
        in this file as they were fairly easy.
        Dustin was proficient at debugging.
    9/19: Memory.C: I wrote and pushed all code. I primarily wrote 
        the constructor and getInstance, Dustin really figured out
        all the rest of the methods of this file. Dustin also was
        able to Debug all our files, esspecially this one. I mostly
        typed the commands did what he told me to do as far as 
        debugging and writing the tougher methods.
    9/23: When we last left off, we were failing the Memory.C tests
        somewhere around the doLongErrorTests(). Dustin was able 
        to fix two of our methods from Memory.C completely on his
        own.  

Lab6:
    9/26: Pair programed during lab with me writing and debugging 
        the code and pushing on my username. Dustin came up with most
        of the algorithms and methods.
    10/5: Worked with Dustin in person on converting char array to 
        String in order to pass in stoul function. Worked on general error
        testing and debugging after that.
    10/7: Worked with Dustin in person on finishing the lab. Error
        testing and debugging, Dustin found solutions for all the 
        errors were needing to handle.
        
Lab7: 
    10/10: Worked in lab with Dustin the full time. edited makefile, 
        copied over files from Tests, and worked on F.C - W.C and 
        FetchStage.C - WritebackStage.C. Worked mostly on setting up 
        these files and doClockLow().
    10/19: Dustin and I met in person to work on FetchStage.C and to
        try to figure out the errors we were getting. Worked on 
        doClockLow() again for FetchStage.C
    10/20: Met in person to continue work on FetchStage.C to try to 
        get icode properly working. Our way of changing icode is not
        registering.
    10/21: Met in person and changed/fixed our FetchStage.C doClockLow()
        and found our icode problem. We actually were not getting any
        right values changed for stat-valC and were able to fix the 
        problem by adding more calls to normal() from M.C to change
        the values.
    
Lab8: 
    10/22: Worked in lab individually, I started on lab 8 writing more 
        to FetchStage and writing the new methods for DecodeStage. Dustin
        worked on solving an old problem we've been having since lab 6.
        Worked on more after lab trying to finish the parameters for new
        DecodeStage methods.
        
Lab9: 
    10/28: Worked in lab coding new methods and changing existing methods
        to DecodeStage.
    11/4: Typed the code for the powers.yo file and tested it with
        existing code.

Lab10: 
    11/5: Wrote the HCL for DecodeStage and MemoryStage. I got stuck on
        mem_read and mem_write.
    11/11: Wrote the logic and figured out the absVal assembly code,
        Dustin typed the code and then figured out how to simplify it.
